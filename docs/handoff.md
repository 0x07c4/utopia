# Current handoff

This is the short, rolling entry point for continuing Utopia on another machine
or in a new agent session. Update it when the active baseline or immediate next
work changes. Keep durable direction in [`vision.md`](vision.md), and keep
session history in [`journal/`](journal/).

## Trusted repository baseline

- The canonical repository is `https://github.com/0x07c4/utopia`.
- `main` was rebuilt from a reviewed product tree on 2026-09-21. Its sanitized
  root is `dd0fea9` (`Initial Utopia workstation product`).
- The replaced repository and its reachable history were deleted. Do not merge,
  rebase, cherry-pick, or force-push from a clone made before this rebuild.
- Treat an old clone only as an untrusted reference. Move it aside, clone the
  canonical repository again, and manually reimplement any useful change after
  privacy, provenance, and host-scope review.
- Public commits use the project maintainer's GitHub-provided `noreply` address.
- Shared behavior and narrow host overlays belong on one `main`. Use short-lived
  branches for focused work rather than permanent per-machine branches.

## Current implementation state

- [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) is the required agent entry point and safety
  boundary.
- Two profiles resolve today: `arch-laptop` and `cachyos-desktop`.
- Profile resolution, artifact mapping, and repository-to-home audit are
  read-only. `python -m utopia audit <profile>` reports matching, drifted,
  missing, and unsafe artifacts without following symbolic links or exposing an
  absolute home path. Capture, deployment, and last-deployment-aware recovery
  are not working commands yet.
- Niri has shared domain-owned configuration plus output-only host overlays.
  Shell, terminal, input, editor, and reviewed development configuration are
  domain-owned. Several other home-relative artifacts still live at the
  repository root.
- [`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) records the exact
  Catppuccin for Kitty and Rime Ice revisions and their bundled license texts.
  The Fcitx theme with unverifiable redistribution permission was removed;
  Fcitx now names its packaged default themes. The separate Neovim submodule
  still needs its own license decision.
- Utopia's original material is licensed under Apache-2.0. Third-party paths
  retain the licenses recorded in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, and the separate
  `editor/nvim` submodule is explicitly outside Utopia's license scope.
- The staged installer remains an unfinished Arch laptop prototype. It is not a
  CachyOS restore path.
- Boot, storage, kernel, driver, and service management remain unmanaged until
  their models, dry runs, validation, fallback, and recovery paths exist.
- Configuration with unclear third-party provenance was removed. Reintroduce a
  behavior through a small reviewed implementation or with explicit license and
  attribution information.

## Current product gaps

Utopia's safety and rebuild scaffolding is currently more mature than the
workstation experience it is meant to support. The repository has reliable
profile resolution, audit boundaries, and a heavily tested Arch installer, but
the distinctive product is still mostly a collection of usable domain
configurations rather than one coherent system.

- The visual system has no shared source of truth. Noctalia uses Tokyo Night
  and a Material-derived wallpaper scheme, Kitty and Starship use Catppuccin
  Frappe, Neovim uses Tokyo Night Moon, and Fcitx currently falls back to its
  packaged theme. Generated GTK/Qt remnants at the repository root are not an
  intentional Utopia design.
- Several declared interactions are not closed product loops. Niri binds a
  browser that is absent from package intent, names a cursor theme that is not
  declared, and hard-codes a localized screenshot directory. Editor features
  reference external tools and a local model service without expressing their
  package or capability requirements.
- The laptop does not currently run the repository composition as declared.
  Its read-only audit reports 7 matching, 7 drifted, and 2 missing artifacts;
  notably, the modular Niri tree and laptop display overlay are not deployed.
  Generated theme state and caches must still remain outside Git when this is
  reconciled.
- The performance-engineering north star is almost entirely unimplemented.
  The BORE/LTO layer currently records a package name and an experimental label,
  but there are no kernel provenance records, controlled baselines, benchmark
  definitions, measurements, tuning overlays, or rollback evidence.
- The separate `nvim-astro` repository still has unresolved template licensing
  and public-history privacy issues. The maintainer explicitly deferred its
  rebuild; do not let it block product work or rewrite that remote history
  without fresh authorization.

## Resume on another machine

If that machine has a clone created before the history rebuild, preserve it only
for inspection and make a fresh clone:

```sh
mv "$HOME/utopia" "$HOME/utopia-before-rebuild"
gh repo clone 0x07c4/utopia "$HOME/utopia"
cd "$HOME/utopia"
git submodule update --init --recursive
git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD
git log --oneline --all
```

The fresh clone should report `dd0fea9` as its only root commit. Before editing,
read `AGENTS.md`, inspect the relevant profile and live configuration, then
create a short-lived topic branch:

```sh
git switch -c work/<topic>
```

Do not copy a complete live home directory or an old repository tree into this
clone. Port one owned domain at a time and review the complete diff before a
public commit.

## Immediate next work

The current repository is clean and both Python suites pass (33 profile/audit
tests and 67 Arch-installer tests). Continue in this order, one focused change
at a time:

1. **Define and build the first Utopia product milestone.** Start with the
   coherent desktop experience: one wallpaper-derived theme source, explicit
   visual tokens, and generated or validated palettes for Noctalia, Niri,
   Kitty, Starship, Fcitx, and Neovim. Preserve a deterministic fallback when
   no wallpaper is available.
2. **Close the interaction and dependency gaps exposed by that milestone.** A
   key binding, font, cursor, application, editor integration, or background
   service must either have declared intent and validation or be removed from
   the shared experience. Eliminate generated KDE/GTK snapshots and default
   application configs that do not express Utopia behavior.
3. **Use the laptop as integration evidence, not as an import source.** Review
   its drift only for the active product milestone, choose the desired behavior
   deliberately, back up live files before replacement, and never recapture
   generated themes, absolute wallpaper paths, caches, or the old monolithic
   Niri tree.
4. **Build the first real performance experiment.** On one host, compare a
   stable kernel baseline with `linux-cachyos-bore-lto` using a declared
   workload, repeated latency measurements, complete environment metadata, and
   a tested boot fallback. This should create the first useful content under
   the kernel, scheduler, tuning, and benchmark domains.
5. **Add supporting machinery only when a product slice requires it.** Capture,
   deployment, installer/profile unification, VM rehearsal, and CI remain
   important enabling work, but should be driven by a concrete desktop or
   performance capability rather than treated as Utopia's product roadmap.

Run the repository checks relevant to the changed domain. The current baseline
checks are documented in `AGENTS.md`; at minimum, run both Python suites and
`git diff --check` for profile or documentation work.

## Updating this file

Keep this document free of credentials, private identity, local usernames,
absolute home paths, device identifiers, backup locations, and transient runtime
state. Record only facts needed for the next contributor or agent. Remove stale
next steps when work lands instead of accumulating a second project journal.
